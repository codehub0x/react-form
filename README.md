# React Controlled Components

## Objectives

1. Explain how React uses `value` on, e.g., `<input>`
2. Describe strategies for using controlled components
3. Explain how we can use controlled inputs to validating text
4. Explain the difference between `value` and `defaultValue` in a React
   controlled component

## Overview

The objectives basically cover it. We want to give students a lot of practice
with controlled components because they're going to be writing this kind of code
_a lot_.

And we want them to be comfortable with `value` vs. `defaultValue` and with
`onChange()`, `onFocus()`, and `onBlur()`.

As a stretch goal, it would be _awesome_ if we could work with them on how to
handle autocompleted fields â€” those can sometimes be wonky, since browsers don't
agree on how to fire events for them (so React can think the field is blank).
